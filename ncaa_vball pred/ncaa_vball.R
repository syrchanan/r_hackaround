# 652 final

# task 0: 

# 1: shooting efficiency has changed over time, from predominantly inside the 3 pt arc to outside, especially due to steph curry and his revolutionization of the game
# 2: inside the restricted area has the highest shooting percentage, and one of the highest efficiencies. I believe it was ~60% shooting accuracy in the restricted area, which equates to about 1.2 points per shot from there
# 3: Players have started to change their shooting habits - but not everyone successfully. some players have made their mark by being more efficient than the average in a certain shot - the midrange jumper, for example. However, since the 3 pointer has become so efficient, most players are starting to migrate towards shooting them. This will occur until a time where teams become better at denying the 3pt shot, where there will be another migration to back inside the arc.
